Python script to parse input.txt and spit out ZZCraftoriumLayout_data.lua
add to .txt manifest
use as data file

can always direct-address X/Z/Y coords, so no fudging commands necessary.
if you need to fudge, just type the absolute coord in directly

ignore ,
ignore all after #

directions: define which coord is the "wall", and whether to + or - from that wall
--
north 	X wall, stations + from wall, rotate stations to face east
south   X wall, stations - from wall, rotate stations to face west
west  	Z wall, stations - from wall, rotate stations to face north
east   	Z wall, stations + from wall, rotate stations to face south

Coordinates
--
X nn
Y nn
Z nn
if nn < 100, then use a predefined value from before, error if not defined
else use direct value
ignore spaces after X Y Z
X Z Y all okay on same line, in this order

Stations
--
station
n stations

hide lamp
- before a station hides first lamp
- after a station hides last lamp

sconce	 	replaces lamp with wall sconce

jw 		next station starts with a jewelry station
ww		next station starts with a woodworking station

jw  Xnnnnn Znnnnn Ynnnnn  manualy place a single station
bs  "
cl  "
ww  "

====
Processing loop

current x z y coord register
station count
first lamp: hide? sconce?
last lamp: hide? sconce?
current direction

upon new coordinates:
- if we have 1+ stations in memory
	write them, using current coords as start and new coords as end
	honor lamp adjustments
	clear station, lamp buffer

Then the add-on rolls through
